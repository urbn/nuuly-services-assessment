# Nuuly Services Assessment

## Objectives

### Exercise 1
* Complete the `/create` endpoint to add new items to inventory to be purchased.
  * Creating purchase orders will increase the inventory by the amount received.
* Complete the `/purchase` endpoint to purchase items.
  * Purchasing items will decrease the inventory by the quantity requested.
  * Only allow items to be purchased if inventory exists.

### Exercise 2
* Update the `/purchase` endpoint to allow purchasing a list of items & quantity (instead of one at a time).
  * Purchasing items will decrease the inventory by the quantity requested.
  * Only allow items to be purchased if inventory exists.

### Exercise 3
* We want our analytics team to see what items were purchased the most/least.
* When an item is purchased, keep track of how many times that items was historically purchased.
* To do this, asynchronously produce a message that is consumed by a separate service to track the favorites.
* This should be done in a non-blocking manner to purchase requests since we just want this for reporting and not block the purchase endpoint.
* Complete the `/favorites` endpoint to return a lists of the most and least purchased items.


### Further notes
* Handle responses to the client in a suitable manner
  * Use appropriate HTTP responses and error handling
  * Return a response data to the client about what was updated
* Update existing code documentation to reflect changes made

## What you are given
* docker-compose
  * PostgreSQL
    * A database to track inventory
  * Apache Kafka (KRaft mode, no ZooKeeper required)
    * A message broker to handle publishing and subscribing to topics
  * Java Gradle application
    * Built with Spring Boot 4.0.3 and Java 17, this is the API server to handle HTTP requests
* Kafka Producer/Consumer
  *  In `ProducerService.java` & `Consumer.java` you can utilize those helper functions to send a message and consume a topic
